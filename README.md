# Description

I designed this as a way to practice my skills with mobile friendly websites.

# Usage

Visit the github pages [here](https://noellerjd.github.io/Web-Design-Agency-Sample/) to check it out!
I recommend using the device tool bar within chrome dev tools and resizing the page to see how it would look on different devices!
